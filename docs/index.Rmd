## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

## Scatterplot
```{r scatterplot}


g <- ggplot(data =mpg, aes(x=displ, y= hwy))
g + geom_point()
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

#### I need color
```{r scatterplot in color}


f <- ggplot(data =mpg, aes(x=displ, y= hwy))
f + geom_point(aes(color = class))
```

#### I need B&W for journal

#### I need color
```{r scatterplot in b&w}


h <- ggplot(data =mpg, aes(x=displ, y= hwy))
h + geom_point(aes(shape = class))
```

### `Shape` now...

```{r shapesize}
ggplot(data =mpg, aes(x=cty, y= hwy, size = class)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_jitter(color= "red")

```

#### Let's play with labels

```{r labels}
ggplot(data = ,mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth() +
  labs(title = "monkey business", x = "bananas", y = "fights") +
  theme_bw()
```
